# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
### A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns to place their marker ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal.

### How to Play
Run the game by executing the Python script.
You will be prompted to choose 'X' or 'O' for Player 1. The other marker will automatically be assigned to Player 2.
The game will randomly select which player goes first.
Players take turns to choose a position to place their marker, ranging from 1 to 9 on the board.
The game will check for a win or a draw after each move.
If one player wins, the game will display the winner, and if the board is full without a winner, it's a draw.
You can choose to play again at the end of each game.

```git clone https://github.com/namrathapmd/TicTacToe.git```
